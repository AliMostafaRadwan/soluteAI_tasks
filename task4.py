st.title("Task 4 - Defect Detection in Fabric")

st.text("""
    we can use two methods to detect the defects in the fabric
    1. Using the image processing techniques
    2. Using the deep learning techniques

    for the first method we can use the following steps:
        1. Convert the image to gray scale
        2. Apply Gaussian blur to the image
        3. Apply adaptive thresholding to the image
        4. Apply morphologyEx to the image
        5. Find the contours in the image
        6. Draw the contours on the image

    for the second method we can use the following steps:
        1. Convert the image to gray scale
        2. Apply Gaussian blur to the image
        3. Apply adaptive thresholding to the image
        4. get a dataset of the thresholded images because it have more details in it
        5. train the model on the dataset (YoloV8 or yolov5)
        6. detect the defects in the maskes images (thresholded images)
        7. draw the contours on the original image

    In this task we will use the first method as it needs more steps and it is more interesting and because of the few amount of images we have we cant use the second method efficiently
    and for the second method we will use the YoloV5 model and annotate the images using roboflow and the rest is easy
